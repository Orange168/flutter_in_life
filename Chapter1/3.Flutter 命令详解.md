## 1.1 build

flutter build apk —help 

> 输出： ${flutter_project}/build/app/outputs

flutter build ios 

> 输出目录：${flutter_project}/build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app

错误1： com.example.flutterApp  App Id 错误

```xml
Xcode's output:
↳
note: Using new build systemnote: Planning buildnote: Constructing build descriptionerror: Failed to register bundle identifier. The app identifier "com.example.flutterApp" cannot be registered
    to your development team. Change your bundle identifier to a unique string to try again. (in target 'Runner' from project 'Runner')error: No profiles for 'com.example.flutterApp' were found:
    Xcode couldn't find any iOS App Development provisioning profiles matching 'com.example.flutterApp'. (in target 'Runner' from project 'Runner')

```

> 分析： 苹果IOS每个新建的APP Id都需要通过云端验证其唯一性，不唯一无法编译成功

解决：Xcode -> Runner(点击)-> signing & Capabilities -> Bundle Identifier(修改)
